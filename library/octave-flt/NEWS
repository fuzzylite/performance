Summary of important user-visible changes for fuzzy-logic-toolkit 0.4.5:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Bug #38018 was fixed (typo in function setfis.m -- wrong function name).

Summary of important user-visible changes for fuzzy-logic-toolkit 0.4.4:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The function readfis was modified to workaround the change to
    strsplit beginning in Octave 3.8.0. Without the modification,
    readfis will not work with Octave versions >= 3.8.0. The new
    version of readfis works with all versions of Octave >= 3.2.4
    by first checking for the version number of Octave and then
    selecting either ostrsplit (for Octave >= 3.8.0) or strsplit
    (for Octave < 3.8.0).

 ** The files writefis.m and evalmf.m were edited to maintain
    compatibility with future versions of Octave. Two occurrences of
    the continuation "..." within double quoted strings in writefis.m
    were changed to "\". One occurrence of "..." in evalmf.m was
    removed by writing the instruction on a single line.

Summary of important user-visible changes for fuzzy-logic-toolkit 0.4.2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The demos embedded in partition_coeff.m, partition_entropy.m,
    and xie_beni_index.m were merged with the embedded demos in
    fcm.m and gustafson_kessel.m.

Summary of important user-visible changes for fuzzy-logic-toolkit 0.4.1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The package is no longer automatically loaded.

 ** The following demo scripts were rewritten and embedded in fcm.m,
    gustafson_kessel.m, partition_coeff.m, partition_entropy.m, and
    xie_beni_index.m:

      fcm_demo_1
      fcm_demo_2
      gustafson_kessel_demo_1
      gustafson_kessel_demo_2

    (The separate demo script files have been removed.)
